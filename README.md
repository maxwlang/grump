# GRUMP ‚Äî Game Routing Unified Mapping Proxy

**GRUMP** is a dynamic TCP/UDP port forwarder designed for game server networks. It is designed to allow safe exposure of private game servers to the public internet by relaying traffic to available internal hosts based on port activity.

---

## Features

- Dynamic routing of incoming TCP/UDP traffic to multiple hosts within a subnet
- Redis-based port scan caching and client rate limiting
- CIDR-based IP filtering and disallowed host control
- JSON-based logging for easy log ingestion and threat detection
- Systemd-compatible for clean daemon operation

---

## Installation

1. **Build the binary:**

   ```bash
   go build -o grump main.go
   sudo mv grump /opt/grump/grump
   ```

2. **Create system user:**

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin grump
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/grump
   sudo chown -R grump:grump /opt/grump
   ```

3. **Add configuration:**
   Create `/opt/grump/config.json` with contents like:

   ```json
   {
     "target_cidr": "10.0.200.0/24",
     "redis_host": "localhost",
     "redis_port": 6379,
     "redis_ttl": 60,
     "redis_prefix": "grump",
     "listen_address": "10.0.100.10",
     "max_scans_per_ip": 10,
     "max_scans_per_ip_timeout": 60,
     "disallowed_hosts": ["10.0.200.1"],
     "port_ranges": [{ "start": 25565, "end": 25570 }],
     "timeouts": {
       "25565": 1500
     }
   }
   ```

---

## Systemd Integration

1. **Create service file** at `/etc/systemd/system/grump.service`:

2. **Enable & start:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable grump
   sudo systemctl start grump
   ```

---

## Logging & Monitoring

GRUMP logs all activity as structured JSON to stdout (journal):

```bash
journalctl -u grump -f
```

Example log entries (CrowdSec-compatible):

```json
{"event_type":"connection","proto":"UDP","result":"RELAY","src_ip":"1.2.3.4","src_port":34567,"dst_ip":"10.0.55.2","dst_port":25565,"timestamp":"2025-04-23T17:52:31Z"}
{"event_type":"udp_blocked","reason":"out_of_scope","src_ip":"8.8.8.8","port":25565,"timestamp":"2025-04-23T17:52:10Z"}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- Rejects spoofed or out-of-scope UDP packets to prevent reflection attacks
- Forwarding blocklist
- Limits per-IP scans via Redis
